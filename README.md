# Nemesys-MVC-Project

Nemesys MVC (.NET 8) is a school project developed by me and my classmate Jurgen. We used ASP.NET Core MVC with .NET 8 to build a website for handling user-submitted reports and investigations.

The application includes features like SQL Server integration, image uploads, automated email handling, and a full investigation workflow. We also used LINQ for data access and wrote custom HTML layouts for the frontend.

The goal was to gain hands-on experience with modern full-stack web development using .NET technologies.
